This dish is perfect for cooking in advance and freezing. Leave to cool, then divide into portions and pour into containers. Place in the freezer and you will always have tasty meatballs on standby. \n", "prep time": "less than 30 mins", "cook time": "10 to 30 mins", "serves": "Serves 4", "ingredients": [" 450g/1lb Italian sausages ", " 2 tbsp garlic oil", " 4 fat or 6 spindly spring onions", " 1 tsp dried oregano", " 4 tbsp white wine or vermouth", " 2 x 400g/14oz cans chopped tomatoes", " 2 bay leaves", " salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", " fresh parsley (optional)"]}
