In many Indian restaurants, however, they list \u2018jalfrezi\u2019, \u2018rogan josh\u2019, \u2018dopiaza\u2019, and then simply change the main ingredient from mutton to chicken to vegetable, so you get the impression it\u2019s always the same sauce. This jalfrezi is specifically for paneer, the Indian cheese, and is little more than a stir-fry, which is perfect for the main ingredient.
