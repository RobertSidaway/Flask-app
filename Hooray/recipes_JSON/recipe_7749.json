The good old stir fry was one of the first things I learnt to cook and has served me in good stead. The trick is in the flavour and a nice hot pan, plus the addition of five spice to the rice gives a nice twist to a plain staple! I have recently developed an addiction to quinoa, which some would argue is better for you than rice due to its higher protein content.
