However, I find polenta (a type of cornmeal) can have a slightly gritty texture. I now use semolina instead \u2013 which is ground from hard durum wheat. It gives a lovely, fine texture to the cake. If you\u2019d prefer to keep the cake wheat-free, use polenta or fine cornmeal instead.\n", "prep time": "less than 30 mins", "cook time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "serves": "Serves 8", "ingredients": [" 200g/7oz unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing", " 200g/7oz caster sugar", " 3 tbsp fine-cut marmalade", " 2 free-range eggs", " 150g/5\u00bdoz semolina", " 75g/2\u00bdoz ground almonds", " \u00bd tsp baking powder", " 2 oranges, finely grated zest only", " 50ml/2fl oz orange juice", " 25g/1oz unsalted butter, softened", " 175g/6oz cream cheese", " 100g/3\u00bdoz icing sugar"]}
