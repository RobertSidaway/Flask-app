I\u2019ve used no sugar, but before you start thinking this is virtuously sugar-free (which I could claim it to be), remember that the sweetness that comes from the dates is, in essence, sugar, though certainly it\u2019s unprocessed and full of fibre at the same time.Make these bars at the weekend, and you\u2019ll be set up for the week if you\u2019re someone who needs to grab-and-go in the morning. \n", "prep time": "less than 30 mins", "cook time": "10 to 30 mins", "serves": "Makes 16 bars", "ingredients": [" 250g/9oz medjool dates", " 2 tsp ground cinnamon", " 75g/2\u00bdoz goji berries", " 75g/2\u00bdoz pumpkin seeds", " 150g/5\u00bdoz brown flaxseeds", " 50g/1\u00beoz cocoa nibs", " 25g/1oz chia seeds", " 25g/1oz cornflakes (gluten-free if required)", " 100g/3\u00bdoz organic porridge oats (not instant)"]}
