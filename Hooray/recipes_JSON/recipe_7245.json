I then remove the ham from the oven, take off the rind, stud the layer of fat on top with cloves and cover with a mustardy black treacle glaze, and put the joint briefly back in a very hot oven. Cooked like this, the meat is astonishingly tender and carves into thin slices with ease; there is also very little shrinkage, and no wrangling with large joints of meat in boiling liquid.\n", "prep time": "overnight", "cook time": "over 2 hours", "serves": "Serves 10-12", "ingredients": [" 3.5kg/7lb 10oz joint boneless gammon, rind on", " 150g/5\u00bdoz black treacle", " approx. 1 tbsp whole cloves", " 4 tbsp black treacle", " 4 tbsp demerara sugar", " 1 x tbsp Dijon mustard"]}
