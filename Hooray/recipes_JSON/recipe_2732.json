The recipe uses black truffles, which are very extravagant and expensive, but a wonderful treat. For a humbler alternative, you can make the terrine with Jerusalem artichokes (see tip), whose gentle nutty flavour is a natural partner to leeks.Equipment and preparation: for this recipe you will need: 2 plastic containers measuring 15x16x5.5cm/6x6\u00bcx2\u00bcin and a hand-held blender.\n", "prep time": "overnight", "cook time": "over 2 hours", "serves": "Serves 6", "ingredients": [" 12 leeks, trimmed to 15cm/6in lengths", " 3 tsp flaked sea salt", " 4 tbsp hazelnut oil", " 1 tbsp Chardonnay wine vinegar", " pinch sea salt", " pinch freshly ground black pepper", " 20g/\u00beoz black truffle, very thinly sliced with a mandoline (optional)", " 10 sprigs chives, chopped ", " 180g/6\u00bcoz Jerusalem artichokes, peeled, halved and steamed for 10\u201315 minutes (optional)", " 8g black truffle, very thinly sliced with a mandoline (optional) ", " small selection of winter leaves, such as lamb\u2019s lettuce "]}
