In the middle ages, they were frowned upon by the Scottish church, viewed as luxurious, decadent English-style food. In later centuries, they proved to be convenient and sustaining snacks for working people, who would buy them hot from pie-men or pie-wives in the city streets. The space on top of the pie, created by the raised crust, would sometimes be filled with gravy, beans or mashed potato.\n", "prep time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "cook time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "serves": "Makes 4 pies", "ingredients": [" 600g/1lb 5oz mutton mince", " \u00bc tsp ground mace", " \u00bc tsp nutmeg", " 5 tbsp gravy or stock", " salt and white pepper", " \u00bd tsp salt", " 120g/4\u00bcoz lard", " 360g/12\u00bdoz plain flour", " 1 free-range egg yolk, beaten, for glaze"]}
