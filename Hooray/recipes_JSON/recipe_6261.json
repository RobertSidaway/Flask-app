A net full of them, red yes, but pink too with flashes of yellow as the sun rose on a still dark blue sea is a lovely recollection, and fried for breakfast later they were quite memorable. A month later though, I saw three autumn mullet in our fish shop and I cooked them simply with a dusting of semolina. I used to think the Mediterranean mullet were better than ours, but now I know the ones that come to Cornwall in autumn are pretty hard to beat.\n", "prep time": "less than 30 mins", "cook time": "10 to 30 mins", "serves": "Serves 4", "ingredients": [" 8 small or 4 medium red mullet, scaled and gutted", " \u00bd tsp salt", " freshly ground black pepper", " semolina, for dusting", " 50ml/2fl oz olive oil", " 2 small oranges; 1 zested and juiced, 1 thinly sliced into rounds", " 1 tbsp capers", " 1 tbsp pine nuts, toasted", " pinch chilli flakes", " small handful flatleaf parsley, roughly chopped"]}
