It is simple to make and is ideal for dinner parties as it sits happily in the fridge for two days. You will need 10 individual 150ml/\u00bc pint pudding basins. If you don\u2019t have little pudding basins, use ramekins, dariole moulds or just set the mixture in pretty little glasses. It will also set in a loaf tin and would slice easily too.\n", "prep time": "overnight", "cook time": "less than 10 mins", "serves": "Serves 10", "ingredients": [" sunflower or vegetable oil, for greasing", " 1 litre/1\u00bepints pouring double cream", " 200g/8oz plain chocolate, finely chopped (50% cocoa solids is fine)", " 7 oranges", " 100g/3\u00bdoz caster sugar", " 4 leaves platinum grade gelatine or 9 leaves regular gelatin, soaked in water for 10 minutes."]}
