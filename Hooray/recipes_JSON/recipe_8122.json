Harissa is a chilli paste with quite a kick; rose harissa, which I prefer to use, is sweeter and less fiery due to the addition of rose petals. I don\u2019t like my food too spicy, so this dish is mild, but if you prefer it hot just add more harissa and good luck! \n", "prep time": "less than 30 mins", "cook time": "1 to 2 hours", "serves": "Serves 6", "ingredients": [" 4 tbsp olive oil", " 2 tbsp ground cumin", " 2 tbsp ground coriander", " 1kg/2lb 4oz lamb neck fillet, trimmed and cut into small pieces", " 2.5cm/1in piece fresh root ginger, finely grated ", " 2 onions, thinly sliced", " 250ml/9fl oz dry white wine", " 400g tin chopped tomatoes", " 2 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e", " 2 tbsp clear honey", " 1\u00bd tbsp harissa paste (preferably rose) ", " \u00bd lemon, juice and finely grated rind only", " 400g tin cannellini beans, drained and rinsed", " salt and freshly ground black pepper"]}
