Making bread one day, Doris forgot to knead it. On tasting the loaf, she discovered it had a fair taste and decided never again to bother kneading her bread. The resulting loaf is heavy, but quicker to make than other types of bread.\n", "prep time": "1-2 hours", "cook time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "serves": "Makes 1 small loaf", "ingredients": [" 225g/8oz strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting", " 225g/8oz strong wholemeal flour", " 1 tsp salt", " 1 x 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast", " 1 tbsp clear honey", " 300ml/11fl oz warm water", " vegetable oil or oil spray, for oiling", " a little milk, for brushing"]}
