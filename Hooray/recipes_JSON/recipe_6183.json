The name is the English translation for the Greek Patsavouropita, created by bakeries as a way of using up old scraps of filo pastry: the \"old rags\" indicated by the title. In Greece, there are two variants, one sweet, one savoury, but this version merges the two, adding honey to salty feta, to create what I can best describe (in taste terms) as a Greek cheesecake.\n", "prep time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "cook time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "serves": "Makes 9 generous slabs", "ingredients": [" 100g/3\u00bdoz soft unsalted butter", " 1 x 270g/9\u00bdoz packet frozen filo pastry, thawed", " 200-250g/7-9oz feta cheese", " 2 tsp grated Parmesan (or alternative vegetarian hard cheese)", " 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves or 1 tsp dried", " 2 large free-range eggs", " 150ml/5fl oz full-fat milk", " 1 tbsp sesame seeds", " 1 jar good-quality clear honey (such as Greek thyme honey or orange blossom honey)"]}
