It is lighter than the classic recipe \u2013 much lower in butter \u2013 and it has a wonderful texture and very clean, clear flavours. You will notice that I have used two varieties of apple \u2013  the Cox\u2019s Orange Pippin has acidity and is wonderfully firm, while the Blenheim Orange begs to be pur\u00e9ed. The combination is what creates the magic.
