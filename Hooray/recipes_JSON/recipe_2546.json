We like it made with a mixture of white flour and rye so it isn\u2019t too heavy, but you can change the proportions if you prefer a darker loaf \u2013 you may need to add extra water if using more rye. We cooked this by the side of a fjord after a trip on a longship, and we ate it with codfish (klippfisk) soup.\n", "prep time": "over 2 hours", "cook time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "serves": "Makes 1 loaf", "ingredients": [" 175ml full-fat milk", " 175ml water", " 2 tbsp dark soft brown sugar", " 1 x 7g sachet of fast-action dried yeast", " 250g rye flour", " 200g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting", " 1 tbsp fine sea salt", " 2 tsp caraway seeds", " sunflower oil, for greasing"]}
