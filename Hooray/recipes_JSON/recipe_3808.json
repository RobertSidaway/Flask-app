I\u2019ve used those ingredients as the inspiration for this gorgeous cheesecake. Make it in summer or early autumn when British raspberries are at their best. If you can\u2019t get hold of any crowdie, ricotta works equally well.\n", "prep time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "cook time": "over 2 hours", "serves": "Serves 8", "ingredients": [" 250g/9oz finely-milled oatcakes", " 125g/4\u00bdoz unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing", " 3 tbsp honey", " 60g/2\u00bcoz pinhead (coarse) oatmeal", " 100g/3\u00bdoz caster sugar", " 350g/12oz crowdie or ricotta", " 350g/12oz full-fat cream cheese", " 4 medium free-range eggs", " 200g/7oz fresh raspberries", " 500g/1lb 2oz fresh raspberries", " 50g/1\u00beoz icing sugar"]}
