I first made them out of turkey mince, rather than my usual preferred beef mince, when I suddenly and uncharacteristically fell victim to the ethos of the age and it came upon me to pander to the low-fat brigade. Obviously, my sub-conscious knew better and directed me thuswards for a reason. It turns out that turkey makes for a light and succulent meatball, which my children love. All in all, this is quite a favourite in casa Lawson these days, and I can be found making a batch \u2013 half for tea and half to be frozen for future outings \u2013 regularly and pleasurably.\n", "prep time": "less than 30 mins", "cook time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "serves": "Serves 4-8", "ingredients": [" 1 onion, peeled", " 1 stick celery", " 2 tbsp garlic oil", " 1 tsp dried thyme", " 2 x 400g/14oz cans chopped plum tomatoes, plus approximately 2 full cans of water", " 1 tsp sugar", " 1 tsp sea salt flakes or \u00bd tsp pouring salt", " black pepper, to taste", " 500g/1lb 2oz turkey mince", " 1 free-range egg", " 3 tbsp breadcrumbs", " 3 tbsp grated parmesan", " 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce", " \u00bd tsp dried thyme"]}
