Here, I\u2019ve served it modestly, on a pile of shredded iceberg, with some warmed pitta, lemon wedges and a tahini sauce. When I make this for groups of friends, or for a family lunch or supper, I slice up some fresh tomatoes sprinkled with mint, and cut some cucumbers into wedged slices, and macerate some red onions, cut into half-moons, with red wine vinegar or lime \u2013 in which case it will serve up to 10 people.\n", "prep time": "over 2 hours", "cook time": "30 mins to 1 hour", "serves": "Serves 6", "ingredients": [" 12 skinless and boneless chicken thighs", " 2 unwaxed lemons", " 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz olive oil", " 4 fat or 6 smaller garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", " 2 dried or fresh bay leaves", " 2 tsp paprika", " 2 tsp ground cumin", " 1 tsp ground coriander", " 1 tsp dried chilli flakes", " \u00bc tsp ground cinnamon", " \u00bc tsp freshly grated nutmeg", " 2 tsp sea salt flakes", " lettuce leaves, to serve", " 250g/9oz plain yoghurt", " 4 tbsp tahini", " 1 fat or 2 smaller garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", " fat pinch salt, or to taste", " 1 tbsp pomegranate seeds"]}
